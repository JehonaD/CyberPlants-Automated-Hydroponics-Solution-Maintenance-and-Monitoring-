# CyberPlants Automated Hydroponics Solution Maintenance and Monitoring

This repository contains instructions for establishing the system to maintain and monitor the solution level via ultrasonic depth sensor, immersible pump, and Arduino Uno. The instructions also explain how to access and download the data remotely via Coolterm and TeamViewer.

> **Note:** Skip to Section 3 if the system is intact and no parts are missing.
